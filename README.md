# Theoretical UV-Vis and Excitation Spectrum using DFT and TDDFT with PySCF

This project involves the theoretical calculation and plotting of UV-Vis and excitation spectra for neutral molecules. It utilizes **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT)** implemented via the **PySCF** library.

## Overview

Using PySCF, we calculate and plot the UV-Vis absorption spectrum and the excitation spectrum of neutral molecules. The results were highly accurate with only small deviations compared to experimental data.

## Features

- **DFT and TDDFT Calculations:** Leverages PySCF for performing quantum chemical calculations.
- **UV-Vis and Excitation Spectra:** Plots both spectra, providing detailed insights into molecular electronic transitions.
- **Accuracy:** The approach has shown to be reliable, with only minor deviations from experimental results.

## Limitations

- **Neutral Molecules Only:** This method currently supports calculations for neutral species only and does not handle ionized molecules.
  
## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- PySCF
- SciPy
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
